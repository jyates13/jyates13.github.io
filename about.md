ssssssssssssssssssssss

My name is Jack Yates and I'm a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I work on exoplanets, astrobiology and biosignatures using models of the Earth's atmosphere, which means that I work in both the [School of GeoSciences](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/) and the [School of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/). 

This is (or will be) my personal website (and/or blog).
