# Me

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/home). I work on exoplanets, astrobiology and biosignatures using models of the Earth's atmosphere, which means that I work in both the [School of GeoSciences](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/) and the [School of Physics and Astronomy](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/). I am a part of the [Palmer Group](http://www.palmergroup.org/). 

Currently we're looking into numerical weather models that we can use to investigate exoplanet atmospheres (two examples are [PlanetWRF](http://planetwrf.com/) and [MPAS](http://mpas-dev.github.io/)). I also use various bits of other models and my own code. Most of my day-to-day work is done with Python and Fortran, but I've also dabbled in various other languages. Recently, I've been enjoying using Processing for data visualisation, and have been learning CUDA. 

Models like PlanetWRF tend to take a long time to run, and so must be heavily optimised and/or run on some sort of supercomputer. Consequently, I also have a passing interest in high performance computing and optimisation. 

Before I started my PhD, I studied Physics and Astronomy for four years at the University of Durham. My MPhys project focused on the detectability of gases (and other spectroscopic features) in exoplanet atmospheres. In particular, I was interested in the use of [KMOS](http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/kmos.html) for transmission spectroscopy. For this project I developed a model (in C) to estimate signal-to-noise ratios during transit observations for a large number of exoplanets in several optical bands.
