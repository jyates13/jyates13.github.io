My name is Jack Yates and I'm a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. I work on exoplanets, astrobiology and biosignatures using models of the Earth's atmosphere, which means that I work in both the School of GeoSciences and the School of Physics and Astronomy. 

This is (or will be) my personal website (and/or blog).
